# CDSM_Lorenz63
Twin experiment with a novel data assimilation method, namely the Conditional Denoising Score Matching

Shen, Z. (2025). Conditional Denoising Score Matching for Sequential Data Assimilation. Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research, accepted.

denoisingL63.py is the main program that show the CDSM algorithm, while perform DA experiment with Lorenz '63 model, supporting figure1 - figure7,
denoisingL63_diff_obs.py further do experiments with different observations, supporting figure8 and figure9.
